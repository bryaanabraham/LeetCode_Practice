3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array

You are given an array of integers nums and the head of a linked list. Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.

Solution: Use 2 pointers for previous and current and change the next value of the previous and current accordingly.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#        self.val = val
#        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def modifiedList(self, nums: List[int], head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        nums = set(nums)
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy
        curr = head
        while curr:
            if curr.val in nums:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        return dummy.next

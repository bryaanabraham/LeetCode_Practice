You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.
A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

Solution: 
- Create a grid of 'F' (free) cells 
- Replace cells with 'Guards' and 'Walls'
- Iterate over all guards and replace 'F' with 'Gb' (guardable) by passing in all 4 directions

        # F: Free, G: guard, W: wall, Gb: guardable
        ans = 0
        grid = [['F' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

                    break
                grid[i][col] = 'Gb'

        for r, c in guards:
            grid[r][c] = 'G'
        for r, c in walls:
            grid[r][c] = 'W'
        
        for guard in guards:
            solve(guard[0], guard[1])

        for row in grid:
            for cell in row:
                if cell == 'F':
                    ans += 1
        return ans
```

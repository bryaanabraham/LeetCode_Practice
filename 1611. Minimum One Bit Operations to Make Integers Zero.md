Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n  == 0:
            return 0
        k = 0
        while 2**k<=n:
            k+=1
        k-=1
        return 2**(k+1)-1-self.minimumOneBitOperations(2**k^n)
```

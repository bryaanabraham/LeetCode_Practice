A square triple (a,b,c) is a triple where a, b, and c are integers and a2 + b2 = c2.
Given an integer n, return the number of square triples such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n.

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def countTriples(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        squares = set([i**2 for i in range(1,n+1)])

        for x in squares:
            for y in squares:
                if x + y in squares:
                    count +=1
        return count
```
```python
class Solution:
    def countTriples(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        squares = set([i**2 for i in range(1,n+1)])

        for x in range(1, n+1):
            for y in range(1, n+1):
                if x**2 + y**2 in squares:
                    count +=1
        return count
```
```python
class Solution:
    def countTriples(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n+1):
            for b in range(1, n+1):
                c = int(sqrt(a**2 + b**2))
                if c <=n and c**2==a**2+b**2:
                    count +=1
        return count
```

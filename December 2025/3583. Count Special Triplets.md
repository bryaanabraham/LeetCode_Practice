You are given an integer array nums.
A special triplet is defined as a triplet of indices (i, j, k) such that:
0 <= i < j < k < n, where n = nums.length
nums[i] == nums[j] * 2
nums[k] == nums[j] * 2
Return the total number of special triplets in the array.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Solution:
- Create frequency counters for the subarray to the left and right of 'j'
- as you iterate over values of 'j' increase the left counter and reduce the right counter.
- if target (nums[j]*2) is in both left and right counters, increment the count by left * right

```python
class Solution:
    def specialTriplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        rightFreq = Counter(nums)
        leftFreq = Counter()

        for j in range(len(nums)):

            rightFreq[nums[j]] -= 1
            if rightFreq[nums[j]]==0:
                del rightFreq[nums[j]]
            
            target = nums[j] * 2

            if 0<j<len(nums)-1:
                if target in leftFreq and target in rightFreq:
                    count += leftFreq[target] * rightFreq[target]
            leftFreq[nums[j]]+=1

        return count%(10**9 + 7)
```

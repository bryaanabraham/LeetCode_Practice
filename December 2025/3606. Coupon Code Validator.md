You are given three arrays of length n that describe the properties of n coupons: code, businessLine, and isActive. The ith coupon has:

code[i]: a string representing the coupon identifier.
businessLine[i]: a string denoting the business category of the coupon.
isActive[i]: a boolean indicating whether the coupon is currently active.
A coupon is considered valid if all of the following conditions hold:

code[i] is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
businessLine[i] is one of the following four categories: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant".
isActive[i] is true.
Return an array of the codes of all valid coupons, sorted first by their businessLine in the order: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant", and then by code in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.

 

```python
class Solution:  
    def validateCoupons(self, code: List[str], businessLine: List[str],
                              isActive: List[bool]) -> List[str]:

        valid_business = ["electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant"]
        def isValid(coupon):
            return (
                coupon[0].replace('_', 'a').isalnum() and
                coupon[1] in valid_business and
                coupon[2]
            )
        
        ans = sorted(filter(isValid, zip(code, businessLine, isActive)), key=lambda x:(x[1],x[0]))
        return [coupon for coupon, _, _ in ans]
```
